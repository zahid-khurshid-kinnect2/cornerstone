                Our infant room is “home away from home” for children 6 weeks to 18 months of age.

                Infants are placed with a primary teacher whose goal is to build trust and a close

                relationship with both the child and their family</p>
                <p>

                We foster your infant’s social emotional development by giving them full verbal and

                physical attention during care giving activities, including diapering, feeding and settling

                to sleep.

                Our infant room has comfy, cribs, cots, beds and feeding area for infants to settle in well

                away from the rattle and noise of other older kids in DayCare.</p>
