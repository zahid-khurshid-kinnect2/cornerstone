                Our school libraries are central to learning and play a key role as a place for encouraging innovation, curiosity, and problem solving. Our libraries are a promoter for literacy , reading , teaching and for scaffolding inquiry learning. School libraries make a difference to students understanding and achievement and provide support for teaching and learning throughout the school. </p>
                <p>The school library is an important part of the school community and reflects and welcomes this community. Our libraries are a place for inclusiveness. Our preschool library is a treasure house of big books, flip open books, pop-up books, textured books and story books. Our elementary, middle and high school library contains a wealth of books of all the humors..</p>
