                Science is different from any other subject. In order to understand its concepts, one has to look beyond the books and conventional classroom teaching. Effective teaching and learning of science involves seeing, handling, and manipulating real objects and materials. The knowledge that students attain in classrooms are ineffectual unless they actually observe the process and understand the relationship between action and reaction.</p>
<p>
At Cornerstone we  combine classroom teaching with laboratory experiments to ensure that their students grasp each  concept.  Students are able to retain the knowledge for longer when they see the experiments being performed in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>
They get a first-hand learning experience by performing various experiments on their own. Students are made to use the models and understand different scientific theories and concepts.  There are several scientific theories and concepts that are difficult to explain directly from the books. Anatomy models, physics science kits, and chemistry science kits for instance make it easy to understand the otherwise complex theories of science.</p>
<p>
By virtue of equipping themselves with the latest and the advanced materials and supplies, schools are able to contribute a lot in the scientific advances yet to come.  Advances and developments in the field of medical science and technology will not take place if we did not prepare brilliant and dedicated scientists and researchers. </p>
<p>
The School has well equipped laboratories for Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Students are encouraged to use these laboratories to learn through experiments. Every year latest instruments, specimens, charts etc. are purchased for these laboratories.</p>
