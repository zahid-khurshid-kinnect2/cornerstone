            <p>Media Room at Cornerstone is a multipurpose space where students absorb  information through this powerful audio and visual aid and sometimes luxuriate on the comfy and cozy beanbags and cushions to enjoy a cinema experience. At Cornerstone, Media Room is more than just watching movies and videos. It is an activity room and conference room with a large flat screen, powerful surround sound and movable chairs to arrange rows of face forward seating and create conversation spaces for different groups as well.</p>
            <p> We bring history into the class through pictures, music and other visuals to a degree never before possible. We communicate with students from other countries. Students are no longer confined to one classroom and the knowledge of one book. The Media unit is utilized to ensure the understanding of all the subjects and concepts through visual and audio aid as well and then through written feedback in the form of a Reflection Sheet.</p>
