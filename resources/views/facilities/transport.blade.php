                Cornerstone School  provides a transport facility to students/faculty members, where the distance from home to school is not walkable. The bus is accompanied by a maid and a security guard. The transport is provided on a first come first serve basis. </p>
<p>
All students are to behave in an appropriate manner when travelling on school transport.      Parents are responsible for ensuring that their child reaches the pick-up point and that they board the vehicle safely. They should also ensure that their child is aware of the need to fasten their safety belt (where provided) and not to move around in the vehicle during the journey.</p>
