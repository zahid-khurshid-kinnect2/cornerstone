                Cornerstone school is providing the transport facility to

                students, where the distance from home to school is not

                walkable. The students are picked up from the designated pick-

                up points. The school bus waits for the student at the pick-up

                point for only two minutes. A nominal fee is charged from all

                the students. School fee collection policy will apply. The

                transportation plan and all the route details can be obtained by

                the school office.</p>
