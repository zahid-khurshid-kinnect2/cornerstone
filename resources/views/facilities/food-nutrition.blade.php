Although food occupies the first position in the hierarchy of our needs, ignorance of many basic facts relating to food and nutrition is still widespread. To add to our studentsâ€™  knowledge of food and how to best utilize it for healthy mind and muscles, We at Cornerstone School have initiated Food and Nutrition program which later developed into a proper curriculum with state of the art well equipped Food and Nutrition Lab. </p>
<p>The Food and Nutrition Program comprises of two components: Practical and Theory. Fun woksheets and activities in theory and Cooking, baking, making salads and deserts in practical makes this lesson fun and a rich learning experience for our preschool, middle and high school students.
