                At Cornerstone Art is all about creating, exploring and innovations. Art strengthens focus and increases attention, develops hand-eye coordination, requires practice and strategic thinking, and involves interacting with the material world through different tools and art mediums.<p /> 
                <p>Art opens the heart and mind to possibilities and fuels the imagination. Art is a process of learning to create ourselves and experience the world in new ways. Our Art activities help a child support the bigger picture of life: beauty, symbols, spirituality and storytelling. It also helps us step out of time allowing one to be present in the moment. Art at Cornerstone keeps the magic alive.
