            <p>The sound proof gym has the capacity to holda huge group of students for the theater, assemblies, matches and other activities. It allows all thestudents to get involved in P.E regardless of their abilities or interest in Sports. Those with a sporting bent are able to fully develop their potential and good training habits, whilst those less interested in sports become involved through the fitness program. We at Cornerstone believe in the fitness of mind as well therefore games like chess, carom and scrabble also are allocated a corner in the gym. Every Friday students gather in the gym for aerobics and yoga to relax; and sometimes karate to train for self-defence.</p>
