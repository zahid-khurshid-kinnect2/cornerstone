                Our schoolâ€™s swimming pool is a covered area with sufficient ventilation. The

                filtration and chlorination systems are of the highest standards, assuring a

                clean and safe pool for our students. Safety at the Swimming Pool is also of

                great concern for us to which end professionally trained Life Guards and

                Swimming Instructor are always at the pool side. First aid equipment is also

                readily available. The changing rooms have lockers for students, who wish to

                keep their valuables safe. The heating system is also installed in the pools to

                facilitate swimming during the winter months.</p>
