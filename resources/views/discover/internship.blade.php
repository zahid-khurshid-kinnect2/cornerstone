             We strive to provide our students with the environment and atmosphere to expand their abilities and experiences.  The Internship program is one of those chances.  Grade 6 students onwards have been assigned with the different departments of the school for two months.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Every day for one lesson these students work with the concerned persons such as the Principal, Vice-Principal, Academic Coordinators, Security, Business Office and many more.  At the end of the internship the students will have prepared their portfolios and will have learnt the duties, responsibilities and pressures involved in the smooth running of the school.
