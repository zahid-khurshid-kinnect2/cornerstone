                Our Middle School is from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The curriculum of the middle

school focuses on the core subject areas: Language Art, Math, Science,

History and Geography.

At Cornerstone School, we understand that todayâ€™s students learn

differently. That is why we continually review our progress to include the

most up-to- date teaching approaches that appeal to our learners.</p>
<p>

Our comprehensive Middle School curriculum combines strong academics

with the necessary tools to develop independent learning strategies that fully

equip your child for success in High School and higher education pursuits.
