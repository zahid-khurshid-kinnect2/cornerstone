               We believe that all students have potential to learn in a variety of ways. Cornerstone High School is a place where students become more confident, caring and capable as they focus on the challenges of a meaningful and well-rounded curriculum. This curriculum is a multi-layered program through which students not only learn the content of each course but also collaborate and practice leadership skills. They develop socially and develop into mature adults. </p>
               <p>The school also offers a variety of clubs from robotics to Mental Maths, making teams and developing sports teams to Guidance Club. Guidance club is one such club which assists the students in vocational decisions and guides them throughout. Cornerstone School is registered at both EdExcel and Punjab Board for IGCSE and Matriculation Examination. After the middle school the students branch out in two directions with different sets of subjects and teachers, course outlines, teaching and testing methods.
